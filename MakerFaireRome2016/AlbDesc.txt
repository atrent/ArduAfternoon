I was born in Milan in 1993 and I graduated in Science at G.B.Vico High School.
I'm currently attending a Computer Science degree at the University of Milan.
Other than Information Technology, I'm particularly interested in cinema, comics and posters.
I've enjoyed to participating in ArduinoAfternoon meetings taught by Andrea Trentini and with this group we attended the project
Arduitter and LightSaber at the Rimini Mini Maker Faire last Novermber 2015.
