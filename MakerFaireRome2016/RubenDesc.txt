I was born in Milan 1992, graduate in computer science at Marie Curie high school.
Now I'm attending computer science degree course at the University of Milano, 
apart from information technology I'm particularly intrested in 3D printing, videogames and bicicles.
From a year I partecipate the ArduinoAfternoon meeting. With this group last November we attended the Rimini mini Maker faire.
