I was born in Milan in 1992 and I graduated in Computer Science at Marie Curie High School.
I'm currently attending a Computer Science degree at the University of Milan.
Other than Information Technology, I'm particularly interested in 3D printing, videogames, and bicycles. 
I've been participating in ArduinoAfternoon meetings for a year and with the group we attended the Rimini Mini Maker Faire last Novermber.
