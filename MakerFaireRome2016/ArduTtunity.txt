ArduTtunity: a simulated remote (Martian?) rover

Introduction
============

Since the beginning of our group (ArduinoAfternoon) meetings in 2011 we devised a way to *reuse* our hardware in many projects so that we could spare on hardware buying. When we started with a robot-like device (the RFID based pub "waiter") we devised a simple set of pieces as a "base" for many subsequent projects.
Our general base architecture is composed by:
- arduino uno/mega stacked with...
- NUY stacked with...
- motor shield connected to...
- two DC motors + rubber wheels powered by...
- a sealed acid 12V DC rechargeable battery regulated by...
- a trimmable power regulator
Then there are some optional peripherals for the diverse usage contexts:
- USB hub connected to the NUY (the wifi onboard the NUY can be used as a control channel)
- webcam connected to the hub (i.e., to the NUY)
- wifi dongles connected to the hub (i.e., to the NUY)
- solar panel to recharge battery
- USB flash drive (e.g., to have an overlay filesystem beyond the limited openwrt on the NUY)

All contained in the omnipresent, robust, "stainless steel", full of drilled holes, student battered baking pan!
