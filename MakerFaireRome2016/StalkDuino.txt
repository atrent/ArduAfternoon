WifiStalker: a wifi dowser robot

Introduction
============

Since the beginning of our group (ArduinoAfternoon) meeting in 2011 we devised a way to *reuse* our hardware in many projects so that 
[idem]


Architecture
============




========== NEW RELEASE
## The architecture:

The base which we start from is our Teglia machine.
For this project the only addons required were an usb hub in which we plugged two wi-fi dongle.

##
The project we would like to apply for the RomeMakerFaire is called StalkDuino, a little machine that
uses arduino to control the hardware. BORING!
The interesting part of this is that the machine is used to spot the wi-fi signal emitter. SO 70ish, meh?
“To take it back from the future” we have developed a system that can allow the machine to know the 
spatial location so it doesn't go on a circle, this is granted by two wi-fi receivers that 
show the signal intensity on each side of the machine.
We hope this project might interest the public and we'd like to interact with them 
via a function called "Stalking", that allows the machine to follow a person as long as 
he enables the wi-fi hotspot on their smartphone.
This project has been developed by a group of student and a professor (survived the students) 
from the University of Milan.







Ciao Andrea,
   questa mattina abbiamo scritto questa presentazione (in tono simpatico).
   Pensi sia adeguato o dovrebbe essere scritta formalmente?
   Partendo da questi spunti:
     -Ricerca wi-fi
     -ricerca la fonte con maggiore intensita
     -cerca, per primi, quelli senza passw?
     -Si salva le ricerche effettuate, cosi' da avere uno “storico” e, in base a questo, cambiare la ricerca
     -localizzazione spaziale
     -Se qualcuno attiva hotspot del telefono, una lasagna lo inseguira'

   Siamo riusciti a scrivere questo:
