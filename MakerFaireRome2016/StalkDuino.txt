StalkDuino: a wifi dowser robot
--------------------------------

Introduction
============

Since the beginning of our group (ArduinoAfternoon) meetings in 2011 we devised a way to *reuse* our hardware in many projects so that we could spare on hardware buying. When we started with a robot-like device (the RFID based pub "waiter") we devised a simple set of pieces as a "base" for many subsequent projects.
Our general base architecture is composed by:
- arduino uno/mega stacked with...
- NUY stacked with...
- motor shield connected to...
- two DC motors + rubber wheels powered by...
- a sealed acid 12V DC rechargeable battery regulated by...
- a trimmable power regulator
Then there are some optional peripherals for the diverse usage contexts:
- USB hub connected to the NUY (the wifi onboard the NUY can be used as a control channel)
- webcam connected to the hub (i.e., to the NUY)
- wifi dongles connected to the hub (i.e., to the NUY)
- solar panel to recharge battery
- USB flash drive (e.g., to have an overlay filesystem beyond the limited openwrt on the NUY)
- RFID reader
- ...

All contained in the omnipresent, robust, "stainless steel", full of drilled holes, student battered baking pan!

The architecture was used in:
- ArduCameriere (RFID based pub waiter)
- ArduGuardia (wiki driven home security robot)
- ArduiTter (twitter guided wanderer)

Architecture
============

The base which we start from is our Teglia machine.
For this project the only addons required were an usb hub in which we plugged two wi-fi dongles.



The project we would like to apply for the RomeMakerFaire is called StalkDuino.
A StalkDuino is a "wifitropic" robot: i.e., it tries to follow the strongest wifi signal it senses.
The pursue of a signal is accomplished by triangulation: using two separate wifi dongles,
the StalkDuino can measure the strength and relative position of any wifi signal it senses and
it can compute the actual direction of movement to go towards the signal source.
The funny behaviour that can be implemented is the "cellphone stalking", i.e., like a faithful dog,
the StalkDuino can stay on a "virtual leash" to his owner (or whoever generates the strongest signal).
